You: i am a lean 22 year old wanting to gain muscle and no dietary restrictions
Bot: **Noted details:**

- Age: 22 years old
- Body type: Lean
- Fitness goal: Gain muscle
- Dietary restrictions: None

**Recommendations:**

1. **Caloric Surplus:** Aim for a caloric surplus of around 250-500 calories per day to support muscle growth.

2. **Protein Intake:** Prioritize protein intake to aid muscle building and recovery. Aim for 1.2-1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.

3. **Strength Training:** Focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses to target multiple muscle groups and promote overall strength and muscle development.

4. **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight or resistance you lift over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.

5. **Adequate Rest:** Ensure sufficient rest and sleep to allow your muscles to recover and repair. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.

6. **Healthy Diet:** Consume a balanced diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.

7. **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day to support muscle function and recovery.

8. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent workout routine and adhere to your nutrition plan to see progress and achieve your muscle-building goals.
